## A Day of Strength and Tears

Jasmine was placed in the High Dependency Unit (HDU), where she was closely monitored. The ward had only a handful of other babies, each incredibly fragile—one baby beside her had only half a heart due to Down’s syndrome, which reminded us just how vulnerable these little fighters were.

Meanwhile, Jenny was moved to the post-labour ward to recover. It was overwhelming for her—physically, mentally, and emotionally—but despite everything, she battled on with incredible strength. Watching her push through the pain and worry for our daughter made me prouder than I can ever express.

That day, doctors sat us down to explain Jasmine’s bowel condition in greater detail, and it was just too much to take in. Jenny and I broke down together, unable to hold back the tears as we processed the difficult news.

There was a glimmer of reassurance when further examinations confirmed Jasmine had a strong, healthy heart, though they did find a small hole (Ventricular Septal Defect, or VSD). The doctors told us this was a mild concern and might not require intervention unless it caused issues later.

The rest of the day was spent back and forth between the Neonatal unit and L44, torn between caring for Jasmine and making sure Jenny was okay. That evening, I had to return home to sort out the dogs and keep the house running. Leaving them both behind was heartbreaking, but I had no choice.
