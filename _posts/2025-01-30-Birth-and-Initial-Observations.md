## Birth and Initial Observations

On 30th January 2025, at 14:10, our beautiful daughter, Jasmine Rose Roberts, was born in Bradford, weighing 5.9 lbs. Immediately after birth, she experienced breathing difficulties and was transferred to the Neonatal unit, where she was stabilized.

As doctors examined Jasmine in the Neonatal unit, they identified several physical abnormalities. Her left eye appeared smaller than her right, and she had little to no visible neck. She also had a pigeon chest and was missing several ribs on both sides—more on the left than the right—which could lead to breathing challenges in the future. However, despite this, her breathing remained stable and largely unassisted. For the first 36 hours, she required additional oxygen to support her breathing, but she made remarkable progress, improving from 95% oxygen dependency to just 21%.

In addition to these findings, Jasmine was born with a hypoplastic (underdeveloped) thumb, clubfoot in her right foot, and a visibly thinner right leg from the knee to the ankle compared to her left leg.

A more urgent issue was discovered with the positioning of her anus, which was too close to her vagina. Surgeons were concerned that she was passing stool through her vagina rather than her anus and determined that she required surgery as soon as possible.

That evening, Jasmine was transferred by ambulance to Leeds Children’s Hospital at Leeds General Infirmary, where she would undergo surgery.
