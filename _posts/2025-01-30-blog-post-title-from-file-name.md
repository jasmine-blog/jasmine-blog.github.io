# Jasmine Rose Roberts - Birth and Initial Observations

**Date of Birth:** 30th January 2025
**Time of Birth:** 14:10
**Location of Birth:** Bradford
**Weight:** 5.9 lbs

Our beautiful daughter, Jasmine Rose Roberts, was born in Bradford. Immediately after birth, she experienced breathing difficulties and was transferred to the Neonatal unit, where she was stabilized.

## Initial Findings in the Neonatal Unit

During examinations in the Neonatal unit, doctors identified several physical abnormalities:

*   **Eyes:** Her left eye appeared smaller than her right.
*   **Neck:** Little to no visible neck.
*   **Chest:** Pigeon chest.
*   **Ribs:** Missing several ribs on both sides, with more missing on the left than the right. This could potentially lead to future breathing challenges.
*   **Breathing:** Despite these findings, her breathing remained stable and largely unassisted. She initially required additional oxygen for the first 36 hours to support her breathing, but made remarkable progress, improving from 95% oxygen dependency to just 21%.
*   **Thumb:** Hypoplastic (underdeveloped) thumb.
*   **Foot:** Clubfoot in her right foot.
*   **Leg:** Visibly thinner right leg from the knee to the ankle compared to her left leg.

## Urgent Medical Issue

A more pressing concern was identified with the positioning of her anus. It was positioned too close to her vagina. Surgeons were concerned that she was passing stool through her vagina rather than her anus, and determined that she required surgery as soon as possible.

## Transfer to Leeds Children’s Hospital

That evening, Jasmine was transferred by ambulance to Leeds Children’s Hospital at Leeds General Infirmary, where she would undergo surgery.
