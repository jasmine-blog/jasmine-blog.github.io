## A Miracle in Leeds

I arrived back in Leeds by 10 AM, where we were told that Jasmine was stable and doing well. They planned to remove her from breathing support that afternoon, another big step forward in her recovery.

I was still struggling to accept the possibility that Jasmine’s left eye might not develop fully, but that morning, I told Jenny that I was thinking about going to a church to get a blessing for her. Later that day, both a Catholic priest and a Church of England reverend visited separately and said prayers for Jasmine. Although I’ve never been religious, I found great comfort in their words.

That afternoon, Jasmine’s grandparents came to visit at 3 PM. My mum, in particular, could barely contain her excitement. Jenny and I went in first to check on Jasmine, and what we saw left us speechless.

Jasmine was off the breathing support—but more than that, she had both eyes wide open, looking up at her mummy and daddy. And she was trying to smile, even with the tape across her lips.

After everything we had endured in just a few days, this felt like a miracle. In that moment, I became a believer—because for Jasmine to turn around so drastically in just a few hours, it could only have been the magic touch of God.

We then brought Jasmine’s grandparents in to meet her. Watching them interact with their granddaughter was beautiful, and it was clear that Jasmine and my mum had an instant connection.

Later that evening, Jenny’s best friend, Poppy, came to visit. She had been a rock for Jenny, and I knew having her there would lift her spirits.

But the day wasn’t done yet—because Jasmine had another big milestone. For the very first time, Jasmine had an official feed of her mummy’s precious milk through her feeding tube. It was a moment of pure joy for both of us to witness, especially after the emotional rollercoaster of the past few days. It was another small but mighty victory for our little fighter.

As the day came to an end, I headed home around 6:30 PM. It was hard to leave, but I knew I had to return to work. I left Jasmine in the best hands—her mummy’s—and gave them some much-needed alone time together.

The past few days have been an emotional whirlwind, but through it all, Jasmine has shown us what true strength looks like. She has faced every challenge head-on, and she is already proving that she is a warrior.

Our daughter may have entered this world with obstacles in her way, but she has already defied expectations. No matter what lies ahead, we will be with her every step of the way, and we couldn’t be prouder of our beautiful, brave Jasmine Rose.
