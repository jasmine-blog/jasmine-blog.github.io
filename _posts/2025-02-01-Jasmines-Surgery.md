## Jasmine's Surgery

That morning, we were told that Jasmine’s surgery was scheduled for the afternoon, and the weight of that news hit Jenny hard. She broke down in tears, terrified of what lay ahead.

The anaesthetist explained that because of Jasmine’s chest abnormalities, she was classified as a high-risk patient under anaesthesia. Jenny later admitted that she feared she might never see Jasmine again, and I knew in that moment that we had to stay strong. I told everyone that as a family, we needed to keep a positive mindset, no matter how hard it felt—Jasmine needed us to believe in her.

And then, our little fighter amazed us all.

Jasmine made it through the surgery with flying colours. Despite the risks, she pulled through unscathed, proving to everyone that she had an unstoppable fighting spirit. To help her recover, doctors placed her on breathing support, allowing her tiny body to rest and heal.

However, while in surgery, the surgeons discovered that one of her nostrils was blocked, adding another concern to the growing list of challenges she faced. They also suspected that her left eye was underdeveloped.

This particular piece of news hit me hard. Anger, sadness, and frustration all mixed together. I remember thinking, “Why my baby? Why her? She did nothing wrong.” Deep down, I knew the doctors were probably right, but I couldn’t accept it—maybe it was my way of coping, my way of protecting Jasmine in the only way I could at that moment. All I wanted was for my little girl to see the beautiful world through her own eyes.

That evening, I left Leeds as a proud father. Jasmine was drowsy from the morphine, but she was stable, and doctors reassured us that she would be fully stabilised by morning. I arrived home exhausted, and it was clear Jenny was struggling, but I couldn’t have been prouder of how she kept pushing forward.
